# Bank-Loan-Approval-Analysis
The Bank Loan Approval Analysis is a web-based data analysis feature for a banking system that uses machine learning algorithms to determine whether a customer is eligible for a loan. The system is built using Python and employs a range of machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Bayes to analyze customer data and predict loan eligibility.
